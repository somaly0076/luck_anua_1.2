                                    Paypal has a unique payment system called the <q>pre-authorization</q>. When a customer places
                                      an order, paypal goes through a review of the payment to verify whether or not they can
                                    approve it. In this process, they charge the customer for the same amount, but actually this is
                                    just a temporary charge which will be pending during the review process. The second charge
                                    will be refunded as soon as the first payment has been approved.
